üí°  **Why this project

Fragrances**, **essential oil**, and different kinds of Aroma expanders are **important** in my daily life. 

My personal experience and many research has shown [**scents affect mood**](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-scents-affect-peoples/), and ***[75%*¬†of all emotions generated every day are due to smell**.](https://www.competitivechoice.net/Articles.asp?ID=343)  I enjoy **different smell** for different **use**, different **weather**, for waking up and go to sleep.  

While having different scents being so important, my room is often **stuck** with **one smell** in a period of time, because my dispenser can only contain one essential oil at a time, and it's **NOT** the easiest job to clean dispenser stones, or diffusers.

The only way to enjoy different smells in a same day is to buy **many** **different** dispenser stone/diffuser, etc.

There must be a better way...
**I'll make a diffuser for many scents...**

# Making

## üå¨Ô∏è¬†Atomiser

First things first, I need atomisers to diffuse scented water. There aren't many options available, and I found these components for sale. This module is driven by a Micro USB and has a holding button. I need to bypass the Micro USB with cables, and solder the poles of buttons to turn it on with Arduino.

![O1CN01EFGe2A2AdYhLfaSjI_!!2081278226.png](IOT%20Scent%20Diffusers%20acdd0605c77e4b8ca6f6ffadbc3f6a32/O1CN01EFGe2A2AdYhLfaSjI_!!2081278226.png)

![IMG_6762.heic](IOT%20Scent%20Diffusers%20acdd0605c77e4b8ca6f6ffadbc3f6a32/IMG_6762.heic)

After soldering, this module still can't simply be controlled by a digital pin, because it requires **5V2A**, which is over the maximum output of any Arduino board.

I therefore require a transistor and a compatible power resource.

![IMG_6622.HEIC](IOT%20Scent%20Diffusers%20acdd0605c77e4b8ca6f6ffadbc3f6a32/IMG_6622.heic)

This is a mimic to the "Project 9, Motorised Pinwheel" of *Arduino Project Book,* I bypassed the button with a jump wire. I don't need an external input to keep the atomiser turned on.

## üåä¬†Water Tank

To make sure one device can produce different scents, I need to either have different water tanks for different essential oil, or to have a shared tank for different oils. I came up with this idea as a simple mechanical solution, the holes for holding cotton stick are slightly smaller than stick itself, which makes oils harder to penetrate and mix with water.

Bear with my sketch...

I prototyped for this idea, and it worked fine ‚Äî not the best, but it works, which is enough.

**Reverse the cap and here we go!**

<aside>
üí´ I've intentionally drilled the hole 1mm smaller than the high-density cotton stick, which prevented the oil mix with water for few hours of testing.

üßê For better precision I would use a *peristaltic pump.* I managed to find one but it is too big for this project, consider I would need 5 of them.

Because I need a water tank, I couldn't use the popular LEGO modelling, I've turned to 3D modelling on Shapr3D, and SLA 3D printing with translucent resin.

## ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Soldering

I have 5 modules, 5 transistors, 1 power supply and an Arduino MKR1000 to embed into a same system. I started by making everything on the breadboard, and then started soldering. I've also laser cut some acrylic board for circuit protection and appearance.

# Coding

## Challenge #1(Wifi Connection)

To make the diffuser change scent along with weather, the first thing is to make it knows the current weather. I had the option to use a WIFI module with Arduino UNO, or to use an Arduino MKR1000, which has a WIFI module embedded.

![MKR is much more compact in size. ](IOT%20Scent%20Diffusers%20acdd0605c77e4b8ca6f6ffadbc3f6a32/IMG_6770.heic)

MKR is much more compact in size. 

MKR 1000 is not only more compact in size, it is also more suitable for physical hacking, as I can solder everything easier without jump wires.

```arduino
//I started testing WIFI connection with ver basic commands.

#include <SPI.h>
#include <WiFi101.h>
#include "arduino_secrets.h"

// I've discovered if you want to share something with a password you can put them in another tab.
char ssid[] = SECRET_SSID;      
char pass[] = SECRET_PSW;

int status = WL_IDLE_STATUS;

WiFiClient client;

void setup() {
  pinMode(5,OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);

  while (status != WL_CONNECTED) {
    Serial.print("Attempting to connect to SSID: ");
    Serial.println(ssid);
    
    status = WiFi.begin(ssid, pass);
    
    // wait 5 seconds for connection:
    delay(5000);
  }
  Serial.println("Connected to wifi");
}

void loop(){
if(client.connected()){
digitalWrite(5,HIGH);}
}
```

üßê The WIFI didn't work with the correct codes.

## Challenge #2 (Arduino Json6)

Now, I need to use MKR1000 to request weather data from specific regions and turn them into input. I start with with finding this weather requesting tutorial on MKR1000 which was very helpful.

[Getting Weather Data](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/officine/getting-weather-data-655720)

<aside>
‚ùó However, this code is still using the old AdruinoJson 5, which is no longer supported by the current Arduino IDE. 

I wasn't able to run the program.

</aside>

```arduino
taticJsonBuffer is a class from ArduinoJson 5. Please see [https://arduinojson.org/upgrade](https://arduinojson.org/upgrade) to learn how to upgrade your program to ArduinoJson version 6
```

The problem really focused on these lines:

```arduino
while (client.connected()) {
line = client.readStringUntil('\n');
//Serial.println(line);
Serial.println("parsingValues");

//create a json buffer where to store the json data
StaticJsonBuffer<5000> jsonBuffer;

JsonObject& root = jsonBuffer.parseObject(line);
if (!root.success()) {
  Serial.println("parseObject() failed");
  return;
}
```

I have no experience with ArduinoJson before, and I had to learn everything from scratch and learn how to convert Json 5 to Json 6.

I managed to learn how to convert with the help of this source.

[Migrating from version 5 to 6](https://arduinojson.org/v6/doc/upgrade/)

It turned out ArduinoJson6 is much easier to use without the necessity of creating ***root.***

This is what I ended up with:

```arduino
String line = ""; 
 while (client.connected()) { 
    line = client.readStringUntil('\n');
    
    Serial.println("parsingValues");

    //create a json document where to store the json data
    StaticJsonDocument<5000> doc;

    DeserializationError error = deserializeJson(doc,line); 
    
    if (error){
      Serial.println("parseObject() failed");
    }
    else{
		Serial.println("success");}
    
		//Print results for test
    String NowWeather =  doc["list"][0]["weather"][0]["main"]; 
    String NowTemp = doc["list"][0]["main"]["temp"];
    Serial.print(location);
    Serial.print("'s current weather is: ");
    Serial.println(NowWeather);
    Serial.print("Current tempreture is: ");
    Serial.println(NowTemp);
    return;
   }
```

<aside>
üßê I wasn't aware that having a while loop here is causing some troubles later on, but it works great so far

</aside>

I was then able to get a json document with:

```arduino
//This print out the entire data requested from OpenWeather.
Serial.println(line); 
```

I can get various data, and I'm choosing the factors that really have impact on people's emotion.

Now I can get the datas with Arduino and pass it to the signal control program.

## Challenge #3 (Build App)

I do not have physical UI on the product, and I will need an App to drive it.

The first thing is I need the MKR connect to my local server and read commands from local IP.

I managed to find a tutorial here:

[How to Build an Android App to Control Your WiFi Enabled Arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7ufemP8e0)

Thank you [ForceTronics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNd_fNspAczm8UoE2ay7K1Q). This a a great tutorial.

This tutorial taught me exactly how to connect MKR with local WiFi network, most importantly it introduced [http://appinventor.mit.edu/](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) to me.

[MIT App Inventor | Explore MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/)

The mechanic is simple, after connected to local server, MKR will read the dedicated URL I access  from any web browser within same WiFi, and read how the line end with.

```arduino
#include <ArduinoJson.h> 
#include <SPI.h> 
#include <WiFi101.h> 
#include "arduino_secrets.h"

......

WiFiServer server(80);

......

WiFiClient client = server.available();   
  
  if (client) {                            
   // Serial.println("new client");         
    String currentLine = "";              
    while (client.connected()) {       
      if (client.available()) {           
        char c = client.read();           
       // Serial.write(c);                
        if (c == '\n') {                  
          if (currentLine.length() == 0) {
            client.println();
						//print response if connected and receiving data.
            client.print("Device conncted");
            client.println();
            break;
          }
          else {     
            currentLine = "";
          }
        }
        else if (c != '\r') {    
          currentLine += c;   
        }
				
				//Naming 5 atomisers status with H5/4/3/2/1, and L5/4/3/2/1.
        if (currentLine.endsWith("GET /H5")) {
          digitalWrite(5, HIGH);
					//Print current device status with user-friendly response.
          client.println("Your Fragrance for a Clear day is On.");
          delay(500); 
        }
        if (currentLine.endsWith("GET /L5")) {
          digitalWrite(5, LOW);
					//Print current device status with user-friendly response.
          client.print("Your Fragrance for a Clear day is Off.");
          delay(500); 
        }

......
				
				//Provide option to turn on all and turn off all
				if (currentLine.endsWith("GET /Hall")) {
          digitalWrite(5, HIGH);
          digitalWrite(4, HIGH);
          digitalWrite(3, HIGH);
          digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
          digitalWrite(1, HIGH);
          client.println("All of your fragrances are on.");
          delay(500); 
        }
        if (currentLine.endsWith("GET /Lall")) {
          digitalWrite(5, LOW);
          digitalWrite(4, LOW);
          digitalWrite(3, LOW);
          digitalWrite(2, LOW);
          digitalWrite(1, LOW);
          client.println("All of your fragrances are Off.");
          delay(500);
        }       
				//This is where user can turn on Auto Weather.
        if (currentLine.endsWith("GET /WeatherOn")) {
          client.println("Turning on Weather Mode.");
          getWeather(); 
          delay(500);
        }
```

I then explored the MIT App inventor, it's easy to operate.

And this is what I ended up with:

Screenshot from video.

I'm almost ready.

## Challenge #4 (Rebuild Logic)

I now knows how to make MKR connect to local server, and to OpenWeather server, but there was a issue that once I connect to OpenWeather Server, I can no longer break the loop.

```arduino
while (WeatherClient.connected()) {
}
```

I need to stop this Weather client once  I have the data I need, and once I want to control it manually. 

I only knew how to use :

 

```arduino
break;
```

which doesn't work because I need it to continue but not return to previous action. I then discovered:

```arduino
continue;
//I'm thankful for this being so straight forward...
```

So now I have the code continues after detecting the weather.

After that I can request the connection to WeatherClient stop.

```arduino
while (WeatherClient.connected()) { 
         line = WeatherClient.readStringUntil('\n');
    
    //Serial.println(line);
    Serial.println("parsingValues");

    //create a json buffer where to store the json data
    StaticJsonDocument<5000> doc;

    DeserializationError error = deserializeJson(doc,line); 
    
    //JsonObject root = doc.as<JsonObject>();
    //deserializeJson(doc, line);
    //auto error = deserializeJson(doc,line); 
    if (error){
      Serial.println("parseObject() failed");
    }
         else{Serial.println("success");}
    //Serial.println(line);
    String NowWeather =  doc["list"][0]["weather"][0]["main"]; 
    String NowTemp = doc["list"][0]["main"]["temp"];
    Serial.print(location);
    Serial.print("'s current weather is: ");
    Serial.println(NowWeather);
    Serial.print("Current tempreture is: ");
    Serial.println(NowTemp);

    if (NowWeather == "Clear"){
      digitalWrite(1,LOW);
      digitalWrite(2,LOW);
      digitalWrite(3,LOW);
      digitalWrite(4,LOW);
      digitalWrite(5,HIGH);
  Serial.println("Clear HIGH");
    }
    else if (NowWeather == "Clouds"){
      digitalWrite(1,LOW);
      digitalWrite(2,LOW);
      digitalWrite(3,LOW);
      digitalWrite(4,HIGH);
      digitalWrite(5,LOW);
  Serial.println("Clouds HIGH");
    }
else if (NowWeather == "Rain"){
      digitalWrite(1,LOW);
      digitalWrite(2,LOW);
      digitalWrite(3,HIGH);
      digitalWrite(4,LOW);
      digitalWrite(5,LOW);
  Serial.println("Rain HIGH");
    }
else {
      digitalWrite(1,HIGH);
      digitalWrite(2,LOW);
      digitalWrite(3,LOW);
      digitalWrite(4,LOW);
      digitalWrite(5,LOW);
  Serial.println("Rain HIGH");
    }
    delay(1000);
    continue;
    }
WeatherClient.stop();
return;
```

Sometimes the getWeather() function reruns without commands, so I added *continue* here and solved the problem.

```arduino
if (currentLine.endsWith("GET /WeatherOn")) {
          client.println("Turning on Weather Mode.");
          getWeather(); 
          delay(500);
          continue;
        }
```

To this step, I've finally completed all the essentials and everything works as I expected.

## ü•≥¬†The Fun Part  (Hey, Siri!)

Hmmm, if I can controll it simply with a browser, and I can use siri to access a browser, then...

**Must Watch!**

Yes, it also use you browser as a external display to update your the current status of the diffuser!
