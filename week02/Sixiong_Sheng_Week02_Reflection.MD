* 1. Reflect on creating interfaces for your body. Consider how we engage with tools â€“ how does this impact how your body extends into the tools around you? What possibilities do you see? *

* 2. Can you see a way they can generate equitable interfaces? What interface would you create to help bring your vision of the future forward? *


# **Make us an interface.**

Wearable devices have been with private customers for years. The most popular wearables besides earwear are wrist-worn, including watches and wristbands (Wearable Devices Market Share,2021). I would argue wrist-worn does not create a new interface for our body. 

Most of the wrist-worn are dependent on smart-phone, which create listed situation:  
	1. Interfaces are mostly screens, some wrist-worn without screens require a phone to operate.  
	2. To reduce user learning costs, interfaces are designed to be identical to phone's.   
	3. Private customers' market allows less personalisation on functions and ways to interact. More personalisations focus on appearance.  
	4. Wearable means more personal experience involved, and customers can be very sensitive to unfamiliar interaction, making designers harder to create new experiences.  
	5. Awareness of data collection is increasing the cost of education of new experiences. (Privacy Concerns Surrounding Personal Information Sharing on Health and Fitness Mobile Apps, 2021.). 

Prescind from commercialisation, there are more ways to interact. Humans sense the world by hearing, touching, tasting, looking, smelling. These are how humans take inputs from the outside world, and each approach has been widely explored by predecessors. The most common interfaces are created based on looking, then there were voice controls based on hearing and vibrant feedback backs on touching. Only take input isn't enough to create an interaction. We also need to give outputs to interfaces. I find how machines can take input from humans an angle worth exploring. The simplest input starts from pressure(buttons); being talked to(voice input); accelerators(gestures), and more. 

There are different kinds of sensors, but not many we would wear on our bodies. For one, not all sensors would work properly with human bodies, and still have reliable data -- Testing body temperature from the wrist likely won't be accurate. For two, people do things for reasons, and we need reasons to wear something unfamiliar -- what benefit does it bring for me, Is this a must-have or just a nice-to-have? 

I find it exciting to bring vital signs into interactive games/experiences. Imagine players heartbeat, respiratory rate, and body temperatures make an impact on the progress of the game. Imagine immersive experience/art vary based on the body parameter, vital signs, voice tone, and create a unique experience for each audience. 

Can we make ourselves into interfaces and allow devices to actively exchange data with us. Allows more complex input into devices and result in more possibilities.
